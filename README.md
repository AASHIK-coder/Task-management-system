# Task-management-system
The task management web application aims to provide users 
with a convenient way to organize and track their tasks. The 
main idea is to create a user-friendly interface where users can 
easily add, delete, and update tasks. By centralizing task
management in an online platform, users can access their tasks 
from anywhere with an internet connection. The project seeks 
to improve productivity and task organization for individuals or 
teams.
